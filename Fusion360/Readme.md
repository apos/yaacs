## These are the Fusion 360 files

There will be no STL files provided. Fusion360 is fre, if you use the licence for hobby or personal users, which has absolutely all functionality you need and really only a frew limitations for free usage (https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal).

You can easily import this project via upload in fusion, then create than the necessary STL files by jourself (clock on the body and right click). Probably you have to adjust this to your needs anyways.
