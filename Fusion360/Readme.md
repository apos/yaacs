## These are the Fusion 360 files

There will be no STL files provided. Fusion360 is fre, if you use the licence for hobby or personal users, which has absolutely all functionality you need and really only a frew limitations for free usage (https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal).

You can easily import this project via upload in fusion, then create than the necessary STL files by jourself (clock on the body and right click). Probably you have to adjust this to your needs anyways.

### YAACS vXXX.f3d

All YAACS related base files including
- hat for Raspberry Pi 4b in certain variants supporting differnet heights and hardware
- hat for PiFinder.io (flat and Newton style combined / interchangeable, fixed lens for PiFinder software  > v2x)
- certain types of dovetails in a special YAACS format (I might alter that to standard Vixen style ones in future). Need for M3 or M4 screws
- special dovetails for Vixen and Losmandy style prism tails

### RaendelSchraube_Diverse vXX.f3d

### Astroberry-EQ6_with_Vixen_Mount vXX.f3d

This is for mount the long YAACS dovetail onto the Skywatchert AZ EQ-6 GT! I did not check, if this works with the standard EQ-6, but should be easily adaptable. Need too glue YAACS dovetails onto it. It is then fixated with a single velcro strip.

**Hint:** you can not use the polar scope, if you do not put a whole into the dovetail! Alter the YAACS dovetail, if you like to use it.
